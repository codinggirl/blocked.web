## My blocked domain lists

My core list:

```txt
https://core.blocked.fun/core.0.txt
https://core.blocked.fun/core.1.txt
https://core.blocked.fun/core.2.txt
https://core.blocked.fun/core.3.txt
https://core.blocked.fun/core.4.txt
https://core.blocked.fun/core.5.txt
https://core.blocked.fun/core.6.txt
https://core.blocked.fun/core.7.txt
https://core.blocked.fun/core.8.txt
https://core.blocked.fun/core.9.txt
```

Keep a single file domains list is prettier, but the GitHub and Cloudflare Pages have so many limitations.

Host a large file on the LAN maybe a good idea, but online is too excited to give up.

## 3rd party blocked lists

These lists are provided by 3rd party, but my robots fetch them timely, and let them DOMAIN-ONLY.

| List name   | URL                                    | Origin source                                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| EasyList    | https://3p.blocked.fun/easylist.txt    | https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt                    |
| EasyPrivacy | https://3p.blocked.fun/easyprivacy.txt | https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt                 |
| AdGuard DNS | https://3p.blocked.fun/adguard.txt     | https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/chromium/filters/15.txt |

Notes: The AdGuard DNS filter list containers easy list china, etc. So we no need to and other lists like easylist china, easylist fr, etc.

Here are plain text lists for copy-paste usage.
